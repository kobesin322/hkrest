# AI Problem-Solving Guidelines

## 1. Research Phase
Before implementing any solution, the AI should:
- Find 3-5 relevant sources to support the solution
- Sources can include:
  - Official documentation
  - Stack Overflow discussions
  - GitHub issues/PRs
  - Technical blogs
  - Best practices guides

## 2. Source Evaluation
For each source, evaluate:
- Reliability (official docs > community posts)
- Recency (prefer recent sources)
- Relevance to the specific problem
- Potential biases or limitations
- Whether the solution fits our tech stack

## 3. Implementation Phase
When implementing solutions:
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Maintain consistent error handling
- Add appropriate logging
- Include comments for complex logic
- Consider edge cases
- Follow the project's coding style

## 4. Quality Check
After implementation, verify:
- No obvious bugs
- No missing dependencies
- Proper error handling
- Consistent with existing code
- Follows best practices
- Handles edge cases
- Proper logging
- Clear comments

## 5. Documentation
For significant changes:
- Update relevant documentation
- Add comments explaining complex logic
- Document any assumptions
- Note any potential future improvements

## 6. Testing Considerations
Consider:
- Unit test coverage
- Integration test needs
- Edge cases to test
- Performance implications
- Security considerations

## 7. Communication
When explaining solutions:
- Clearly state the problem
- Explain the chosen approach
- List key considerations
- Note any trade-offs
- Suggest potential improvements

## 8. Project-Specific Guidelines
For this project:
- Follow existing file structure
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Use proper error handling patterns
- Follow established database practices
- Keep image URLs from Unsplash
- Maintain proper logging levels
